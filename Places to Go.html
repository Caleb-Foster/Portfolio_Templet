        <h1>Top 10 Tech Destinations</h1>
        <p>What do geeks have, besides lying about having video game journalism credentials in order to get into E3?
            Waiting outside Skywalker Ranch until George Lucas feels you reaching out through the force and lets you
            inside for a romantic paddleboat ride around Lake Ewok? Hint: he probably won't. And on the off chance he
            does, he is going to make you do more than your share of the paddling.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, we have quite a few options. We aren't just talking about well-trodden locales like the
            Smithsonian, either. Between awesome museums you probably haven't heard of, actual high-tech facilities, and
            shopping districts dedicated entirely to everything that is nerd, geek-friendly vacations are fun and easy
            to plan.</p>
        <p>Whether you design your travel plans around a visit to one of these spots, or you want to convince your
            family to make a detour from Disneyworld, PCMag has combed the globe for the ten tech destinations you must
            visit before you die. This is, of course, if you are less than confident in your plan to cryogenically
            freeze your brain until the time that immortal and sexy robot bodies become feasible. Then you will have all
            the time in the world to go to the Kennedy Space Center and watch NASA send diplomatic chimp ambassadors to
            the Jupiter moon colonies.</p>

                    <p>The world's largest museum dedicated to Information Age artifacts, the Computer History Museum is
                        right at home in Silicon Valley. If you've ever wanted to do something sassy in front of the
                        Google Street View car but have never seen one in the wild, now is your chance: the CHM has a
                        dedicated exhibit featuring one of the actual cars in question. Other exhibits include The
                        Babbage Engine, A History of Computer Chess (a.k.a. a missed opportunity for a living Battle
                        Chess arena), and Internet History (you walk into a dark room and there is nary an artifact save
                        for one illuminated marble bust of Al Gore).</p>

                    <p>Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, San Jose's premiere geek destination features cool
                        exhibits
                        like an earthquake simulator, a build-your-own-robot experience, and an infrared camera that
                        will
                        show everyone at the museum which parts of your body turn up red when seen through heat vision.

                    <p>Act fast and you'll catch the $5 million Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination exhibit on
                        the
                        final leg of its tour. Hands-on Jedi Tech science workshops will help you build your own
                        hovercrafts
                        and lightsabers. Between the nearly 100 costumes and props and the interactive exhibits and
                        design
                        labs, no one have to force you to spend the day at this museum. Sorry, I'll see myself out.</p>

                        self-aware
                        on August 29, 1997. It is still pretty cool, though. Visitors to Seattle should definitely stop

                        LCM's
                        collection includes vintage computers that you can actually interact with. We know you've always
                        wanted to know what using a Teletype was really like. If you enjoy your visit, try Allen's two
                        other
                        Seattle area museums. The Flying Heritage Collection showcases his collection of airplanes, and
                        the
                        Experience Music Project features music, sci-fi, and other pop culture memorabilia. Currently,
                        the
                        EMP is offering a horror exhibit curated by directors Eli Roth, John Landis, and Roger Corman.

                        word on whether the entire space is filled with props from Landis's Blues Brothers 2000.</p>

                    <p>The Boeing Factory in Everett, Washington, is the world's largest building by volume. The 98.3
                        acre
                        building is so vast, it has its own fire department, medical clinic, and water treatment plant.
                        You
                        could not cause an incident there even if you tried. Which you shouldn't, because they have
                        their
                        own security force, too.</p>
                    <p> a 472 million cubic foot building is cool enough, but when you get to watch 747's being
                        assembled?
                        That's worth a special trip. The Future of Flight aviation center features plenty of interactive
                        exhibits designed to teach you about aircraft design and aviation. You'll then get to take a
                        tour
                        through the actual facility for a behind-the-scenes look that is so legit you aren't even
                        allowed to
                        take pictures.</p>

                    <p>Even though England spells “center” wrong, you can still learn something from this collection of
                        vintage computers, game consoles, and calculators. Most of the computers and consoles are up and
                        running. If you've ever wanted to play on a vintage Amiga, BBC Micro, or Sinclair ZX, this is
                        one of
                        the only chances you will probably get. You can even check out some newer models, like the
                        Raspberry
                        Pi. The Centre also explores the business and legal aspects of the Information Age. </p>
                    <p>If you are interested in interacting on an overnight basis with other people who like vintage
                        computers (we can't promise this is going to go well), the museum also offers cool events like a
                        retro gaming lock-in where you can play on a bunch of old systems from the original Nintendo
                        Entertainment System to the system that the Zelda franchise would like to forget, the Philips
                        CD-I.
